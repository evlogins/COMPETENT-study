ABSTRACT

**Background and Objective**

Anaesthesia induction is challenging in high-risk cardiac patients.
Etomidate is frequently used in these patients because of its favourable
haemodynamic profile in minimizing induction hypotension. However,
etomidate suppresses adrenocortical function by inhibiting
11β-hydroxylase. Sevoflurane has been shown to have little haemodynamic
impact and is suitable for inhalation induction. This study aims to
compare the haemodynamic effects of intravenous (i.v.) and inhalation
induction of anaesthesia in high-risk patients.

**Design**

A retrospective single-center cohort study.

**Setting**

University Hospital in Germany between the years 2019 and 2020.

**Patients**

Seventy-five patients scheduled for interventional mitral valve repair.

**Methods**

We retrospectively analysed the data of 57 patients classified as ASA IV
(American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification) who
received either etomidate or sevoflurane for induction of anaesthesia.
We compared the patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, vital
signs and medication administered.

**Results**

Thirty-two individuals (56 %) received inhalation induction using
sevoflurane and 25 (44 %) received i.v. induction using etomidate. Both
groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, body mass index, and
underlying diseases. Blood pressure and heart rate did not show major
differences between the groups; however, there was significantly less
use of cafedrine-theodrenaline (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.29 to
5.59 ml, P\<0.001) and quantitatively less use of noradrenaline (95%
confidence interval (CI), 2.67 to 38.65 µg, P\<0,025) in the inhalation
induction group.

**Conclusions**

Inhalation induction using sevoflurane is feasible in patients for
interventional mitral valve repair and requires less vasopressor support
for haemodynamic stability compared to i.v. induction using etomidate.

# INTRODUCTION

Anaesthesia induction is challenging in high-risk cardiac patients. Most
i.v. drugs used for induction have a detrimental effect on patient
haemodynamics,^1-3^ leading to hypotension, dysrhythmia, and cardiac
arrest. Hypotension affects clinical outcomes^4,5^ and has been related
to elevated postoperative morbidity and mortality.^5-8^ To avoid
postinduction deterioration, etomidate is frequently used in high-risk
cardiac patients with reduced ejection fraction because of its
favourable haemodynamic profile in minimizing induction hypotension.
However, etomidate suppresses adrenocortical function by inhibiting
11β-hydroxylase.^9^ Even doses of etomidate as small as 0.04 mg kg^-1^
block the enzyme,^10^ and a typical dose used for induction of general
anaesthesia (i.e., 0.3 mg kg^-1^) suppresses the otherwise normal
increase in plasma cortisol concentration in response to surgical
stimulation.^11^ Another popular choice for inducing anaesthesia in
high-risk patients is midazolam. Although its impact on patient
haemodynamics is also rather low,^12^ the use of benzodiazepines is
suspected to increase the risk for delirium in critically ill
adults.^13^ Furthermore, the elimination half-life of midazolam ranges
from 1.7 to 3.5 h and is most likely longer in older patients.^14^ This
makes midazolam less preferable in the context of interventional mitral
valve repair, as most patients are of older age and the duration of the
procedure is regularly \<2 h. Propofol is quite popular when general
anaesthesia is induced. Owing to its effect on blood pressure^15-17^
many anaesthesiologists tend to avoid propofol when caring for high-risk
patients.

Previous studies have shown that general anaesthesia induced by
inhalation agents, such as sevoflurane, has a comparatively low effect
on blood pressure.^18^ The blood/gas solubility of sevoflurane is
comparatively low,^19^ allowing rapid induction, easy adjustment of
anaesthesia depth, and early recovery. When performed during coronary
artery bypass surgery (CABG), sevoflurane use reduces postoperative
cardiac biomarker release and length of hospital stay compared to total
i.v. anaesthesia.^20^ However, information regarding the application of
this induction technique to high-risk cardiac patients with or without
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is lacking. Therefore,
in this study, we evaluated the effects of inhalation induction with
sevoflurane versus etomidate in adult high-risk cardiac patients
undergoing interventional mitral valve repair.

# METHODS

**Ethical approval of the study protocol**

The present study was conducted in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments. Ethical approval for this study
(approval number S-109/2021) was provided by the Ethics committee of the
Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany
(Chairperson Prof. Dr. med. Dr. h.c. T. Strowitzki) on 03.03.2021.

**Data collection**

A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the haemodynamic
effects of anaesthesia induction with sevoflurane compared to etomidate
in high-risk cardiac patients undergoing interventional mitral valve
repair at Heidelberg University Hospital. All patients aged ≥18 years
who underwent elective interventional mitral valve repair between
December 2019 and December 2020 were included in data assessment and
screened for eligibility from a prospectively maintained database at our
institution. Electronic medical and anaesthetic records were reviewed
for demographic and clinical characteristics, concomitant diseases,
medications, haemodynamic measurements, and the prevalence and nature of
adverse events and complications. Patients who received sedative or
analgesic drugs other than sevoflurane, etomidate, and remifentanil
during the first 20 min of the procedure and those with incomplete data
sets were excluded from the final analysis (**Fig. 1**).

**Outcome measures**

The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of arterial hypotension
within 20 min after anaesthesia induction. Secondary outcome measures
were the need/quantity of vasopressors and/or inotropes required to
correct hypotension and the prevalence of adverse events (laryngospasm
and breath-holding). Hypotension was defined as a systolic blood
pressure \<90 mmHg, which necessitated the administration of
vasopressors and/or inotropes.

Intraoperative haemodynamics were assessed at five pre-defined points:

-   T0: Haemodynamic baseline immediately prior to anaesthesia induction

-   T1: 5 minutes after anaesthesia induction

-   T2: 10 minutes after anaesthesia induction

-   T3: 15 minutes after anaesthesia induction

-   T4: 20 minutes after anaesthesia induction

## **Anaesthetic procedure**

## 

**Patient preparation**

All procedures applied to the participating patients were performed in
the hybrid catheterization unit of our hospital. Routine dual-channel
ECG (DII, V5), pulse oximetry (SpO~2~), and noninvasive arterial blood
pressure monitoring were performed. After administering local
anaesthesia, the left or right radial artery was cannulated for invasive
arterial blood pressure monitoring. Central venous catheterization was
performed either before (using local anaesthesia) or after anaesthesia
induction.

**Anaesthesia induction**

In our department, anaesthesia induction for interventional mitral valve
repair is performed without premedication using etomidate or sevoflurane
in combination with remifentanil or sufentanil, considering the physical
status of the patient and the preferences of the attending
anaesthesiologist. For i.v. induction, etomidate was administered at a
dosage of 0.3 mg kg^-1^ bodyweight. Alternatively, sevoflurane was
administered using a facial mask to induce anaesthesia. After
pre-oxygenation for 3 min, the gas flow on the anaesthesia machine was
set to 6 l min^-1^ oxygen, and sevoflurane was titrated to the patient's
needs, starting with a sevoflurane vaporizer set between 1.5 and 2
Vol.%, depending on the patients age and physical status. The depth of
anaesthesia was assumed sufficient as soon as the ciliary reflex could
not be triggered. Subsequently, rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg kg^-1^) was
used as a muscle relaxant. Cis-Atracurium (0.15 mg kg^-1^) was used
alternatively in patients suffering from kidney failure. A single bolus
of remifentanil (1 µg kg^-1^ bodyweight) was administered over two
minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.05 µg kg^-1^ bodyweight per
minute. Endotracheal intubation was performed in all patients, followed
by mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml kg^-1^ predicted
bodyweight and a ventilation frequency of 12--16 breaths per minute to
maintain an end-tidal CO~2~ concentration between 35 and 45 mmHg. After
induction of anaesthesia, a transoesophageal echo probe was inserted.
For anaesthesia maintenance, sevoflurane was administered and titrated
to a target minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7 to all patients.

Both induction techniques were available and could be used for the same
purpose. The use of etomidate or sevoflurane for induction was at the
physician's discretion. The concomitant use of both substances offered
the opportunity to conduct a retrospective analysis comparing etomidate
and sevoflurane for routine use.

Depending on the chosen induction technique, the patients were assigned
to the group that received etomidate (etomidate group) or inhaled
sevoflurane for induction (sevoflurane group).

**Haemodynamic and fluid management**

The systolic arterial blood pressure was maintained \>90 mmHg, while the
mean arterial pressure was maintained \>65 mmHg. Arterial hypotension
was corrected with a bolus of cafedrine-theodrenaline and/or
norepinephrine, as required. Dobutamine was administered when
norepinephrine and cafedrine-theodrenaline were insufficient to maintain
previously defined haemodynamic goals. The use of fluids was generally
avoided during this procedure because most patients suffered from
moderate-to-severe heart insufficiency.

## **Statistical analysis**

Descriptive statistics for empirical distributions are presented as mean
± SD in case of continuous data or as absolute and relative frequencies
in case of categorical data. Possible differences between patient groups
were evaluated using the Mann--Whitney U test for continuous variables
and the χ^2^ test or Fisher's exact test (where appropriate) for
categorical variables. The effect sizes were calculated according to
Cohen's method. The 95 % CI of the differences were calculated. P-values
\< 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were
performed using SASTM 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

# RESULTS

**Patient characteristics**

Between April 2019 and November 2020, 179 patients underwent
interventional mitral valve repair at our institution. Overall, 122
patients were excluded from the final data analysis because they used
hypnotic or analgesic drugs other than sevoflurane, etomidate, or
remifentanil within the first 20 min during or after induction (Fig. 1).
Of the remaining 57 patients, 32 individuals (56 %) received inhalation
induction using sevoflurane, whereas 25 (44 %) received i.v. induction
using etomidate. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, body
mass index, underlying diseases, and pre-operative treatment, except for
the use of angiotensin receptor blockers, which were more prevalent in
the etomidate group (p=0.033) (**Table 1**). However, the long-term
medication administered in the morning before the intervention did not
differ between the groups. **Table 1** summarizes the baseline
characteristics of the included patients. In accordance with the ASA
Physical Status Classification System,^21^ all patients were graded as
ASA IV owing to severe valve dysfunction. Nearly half of the patients
(43.9 %) also suffered from severely reduced left ventricular function,
and \>90 % were classified according to the New York Heart Association
(NYHA) Functional Classification as NYHA III or IV. Many of these
patients also suffered from secondary effects of severe heart
insufficiency like kidney failure (52.6 %) and/or cardiac decompensation
in recent history (57.8 %).

## **Haemodynamics** 

Baseline haemodynamic variables (heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and
mean arterial pressure) were comparable between the groups (**Fig.
2--4**). Patients who received etomidate for induction showed a
significant decrease in mean arterial pressure from baseline at time
points 2, 3, and 4. The effect size, according to Cohen's method, was
0.7, indicating a moderate impact strength. The same was true for
systolic and diastolic blood pressures at timepoint 2,3, and 4 (**Table
4**). The heart rate decreased significantly at time points 2 and 4
compared to baseline.

Patients who received sevoflurane for induction showed a significant
decrease in mean arterial pressure from baseline at all time points
during the study period. According to Cohen's method, the effect size
was 0.73, indicating a moderate impact strength. Systolic blood pressure
decreased significantly at all time points (**Table 5**). The diastolic
blood pressure and heart rate dropped significantly from baseline at
time points T2--T4.

However, intergroup comparisons revealed no changes in these variables
during the study period (**Table 3**).

Cafedrine-theodrenaline was used significantly less frequently in
patients of the sevoflurane group than in patients of the etomidate
group (P\<0.001) (**Table 2**). Quantitatively, noradrenaline was used
less in the sevoflurane group (P\<0.025) (**Table 2**). Dobutamine was
not administered to the patients in the sevoflurane group.

# Complications

No complications were recorded in either groups.

# Discussion

The present retrospective pilot study suggests that inhalation induction
using sevoflurane is not inferior to i.v. induction using etomidate with
respect to the preservation of blood pressure and use of antihypotensive
medication. Patients who received inhalation induction with sevoflurane
had significantly lower use of noradrenaline and cafedrine-theodrenaline
than those who received i.v. induction with etomidate (p\<0.001). These
findings are consistent with those of previous studies, which have
demonstrated a comparatively low impact of inhalation induction on
haemodynamics, particularly when compared with i.v. induction using
propofol. For instance, Thwaites et al. found that inhalation induction
using sevoflurane was associated with less hypotension compared to
propofol, even at high doses of sevoflurane (8 %).^18^ Similarly, Dhande
et al. reported a greater (p\<0.05) fall in mean arterial blood pressure
with propofol induction (28.48 %) compared to sevoflurane (14.61 %).^22^
Nishikawa et al. observed a similar decrease in mean arterial blood
pressure when comparing inhalation induction with sevoflurane to
propofol; however, they also found that left ventricular mechanical
performance was less affected by inhalation induction.^23^

Cheong et al. concluded that the blood pressure of patients undergoing
CABG remained higher when using etomidate compared to inhalation
induction using sevoflurane.^24^ However, in their study, a much higher
dose of sevoflurane (4 % sevoflurane + 67 % nitrous oxide) and lower
doses of etomidate (0.2 mg kg^-1^) were used than in our study, which
could contribute to the contradictory results. Furthermore, Cheong et
al. excluded patients with an LVEF \<40 %, whereas in our study, 57.9 %
of the patients had an LVEF of ≤44 % (43.9 % were \<30 %), affecting the
comparability of the study populations.

Djaiani et al. also compared etomidate to inhalation induction using
sevoflurane and concluded that the degree of hypotension after
inhalation or i.v. induction techniques was similar between the
groups.^25^ In this study, the dose of etomidate was the same as that
used in our study (0.3 mg kg^-1^); however, the dose of sevoflurane was
also much higher (8 %).^25^ However, patients with an LVEF \<40 % were
also excluded from their study, making the results less comparable to
our study.

Most studies that have compared inhalation induction with i.v. induction
using propofol or etomidate have used much higher doses of sevoflurane
than those used in our study. We hypothesized that most researchers
would attempt to achieve a rapid onset of anaesthesia by using high
doses of sevoflurane with the addition of nitrous oxide. However, our
aim was not to achieve rapid onset of anaesthesia. To the best of our
knowledge, the only study using similar doses of sevoflurane for
induction was conducted by Dhande;^22^ however, in their study, the
addition of nitrous oxide was used. Therefore, the dosing of sevoflurane
during inhalation induction may be a reason for the partially
contradictory results of the cited articles. Moreover, our study
population was distinct from those of other studies, which could affect
the comparability of the results.

In our department, we regularly perform inhalation induction when
inducing anaesthesia in high-risk cardiac patients. In our opinion,
inhalation induction offers several opportunities for i.v.
administration. For example, inhalation induction offers the possibility
of easily titrating the desired depth of anaesthesia even during
induction. This can be extremely beneficial regarding patient
haemodynamics and, when combined with measurement of the depth of
anaesthesia, potentially reduces the risk of postoperative delirium by
avoiding unnecessary deep anaesthesia.^26,27^ Furthermore, since
sevoflurane is used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, we
apply only one sedative drug, thereby reducing the risk of unwanted side
effects. Since sevoflurane is mostly eliminated through the lungs at the
end of anaesthesia, there is no risk of its accumulation, even in
patients with kidney or liver failure. In the case of on-pump CABG,
inhalation induction may be especially beneficial owing to
cardioprotection, which has been described when using
sevoflurane.^20,28^

As a minor aspect, some researchers also came to the conclusion that
induction using sevoflurane is more cost-effective than using
propofol.^22^

In conclusion, we believe that this method is a valuable option when
treating high-risk cardiac patients, as we consider it to be safe and
beneficial for the patients. Prospective randomized clinical studies are
required to provide more evidence on this subject and to further define
the limitations and advantages of this technique.

# Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, this was a retrospective
cohort study with a highly selected group of high-risk patients who
underwent a unique intervention. Therefore, these results may not be
applicable to other patients. However, this design enabled us to compare
anaesthetic techniques and perioperative management of high-risk cardiac
patients in a highly standardized perioperative care setting. Second,
because perioperative anaesthetic documentation at our institution was
mainly paper-based during the study period, automated data extraction
was not feasible. Third, because of the retrospective nature of the
study, we only acquired the patients' blood pressure and heart rate,
although cardiac output is more crucial and interesting, despite being
much more complex to measure.
